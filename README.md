# Anti-Floating-Point-Error
This is a package that makes python calculates like a human and not like a computer.
 ``` python
 >>> import Anti_Floating_Point_Error as afpt
 >>> aftp.clac(0.1 + 0.2)
0.3
 ```
## Idea
The whole idea is to make a calculator calculate like a human. I literally mean it.

It sound really absurd, but I think it is easier than I thought, but I have to test to know how hard it is.

A number with more than 5 decimal places cannot be calculated. At least for now.
